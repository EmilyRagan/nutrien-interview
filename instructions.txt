Expectations:
Using Typescript with any framework(s) you enjoy
Feel free to be creative, but the result NEED NOT BE COMPLEX or excessively time-consuming
We will review your work together during the in-person interview
Send a link to the source, a repository URL or a zip file of your project the day before your interview day
Exercise:
Start with the included Projection2021.csv file. Ignore FeedGrains.csv for now.
Create an API service that provides a GET histogram route for each column in the table. For example, the following URLs should be successfully resolved by the service:
http://localhost/Commodity/histogram
http://localhost/CommodityType/histogram
Etc.
A GET request on any of these URLs should return HTML with the count of how many times each unique value appears in that column of the data. For example in the Commodity column, “Rice” appears 216 times, “Corn” 240, etc.
This service should be runnable using one of:
Host it on AWS, feel free to use Lambdas (preferred) or In Docker using docker-compose up or docker run command you provide
A simple readme describing how to start the service
Be prepared to talk about one aspect of this exercise you found interesting, or feel free to add (or not) any optimization or feature you find interesting and would like to talk about.
